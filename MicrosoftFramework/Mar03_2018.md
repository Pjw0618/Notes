   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/libraries#retargeting-your-net-framework-code-to-net-framework-462
   1-1: Third Party Dependencies (NuGet packages)
   1-2: Target the .NET Standard Library
   1-3: Retarget Projects
	All the projects to be ported need to be targeted to .NET Framework 4.6.2. To ensures the availability of the latest API.
   1-4: Port Tests Code (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)

Recommended approach to porting:
   1. Begin from the base of library (This might be data models or some other foundational classes and methods that everything else uses directly or indirectly)
   2. Layer by layer
	- Copy base of library, select version
	- Make changes to make code to compile (may require adding NuGet package dependencies to csproj file)
	- Test and adjustment
	- Next layer
